 Netflix Movies and TV Shows Recommendation System

This repository features a hybrid recommendation system built using Python, which leverages a dataset of Netflix movies and TV shows. The system utilizes both collaborative and content-based filtering techniques to recommend movies and TV shows to users based on various attributes such as cast, director, country, genre, and ratings.

Key Components:

•	Dataset: The dataset includes over 8,000 Netflix titles, providing detailed information such as title, director, cast, country, rating, genre, and release year. It serves as the foundation for building an effective recommendation system.

•	Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and Feature Engineering:

o	Performed EDA to identify patterns, outliers, and relationships between variables using visualizations like bar charts and line charts.

o	Carried out feature engineering techniques including feature creation, transformation, extraction, and scaling to enhance the predictive performance of the recommendation model.

•	Hybrid Recommendation System:

o	Combines both content-based and collaborative filtering approaches to address the limitations of each individual technique.

o	Uses machine learning algorithms to predict user preferences and recommend relevant content.

o	Integrates Natural Language Toolkit (NLTK) for processing textual data to enhance recommendations based on movie descriptions.

•	Methodology and Results:

o	Implemented a step-by-step process starting with data cleaning, handling missing values, and identifying duplicates.

o	Developed machine learning models for recommendation and evaluated their performance to improve accuracy.

•	Visualizations:

o	Includes various plots to visualize data distributions, common movie/show titles, popular directors, and more to facilitate understanding of the dataset.

Notebooks:

•	Jupyter notebooks documenting the entire process from data exploration, cleaning, modeling, to building the recommendation system.
